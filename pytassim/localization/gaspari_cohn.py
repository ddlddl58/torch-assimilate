class GaspariCohn(BaseLocalization):
    """
    This localization can  be used to constrain observations. It is based on
    Gaspari-Cohn correlation function [GC99]_. This correlation function is
    similar to a gaussian with truncation.

    References
    ----------
    .. [GC99] Gaspari, G., & Cohn, S. E. (1999).
              Construction of correlation functions in two and three dimensions.
              Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 125(554),
              723â€“757.

    Parameters
    ----------
    length_scale : float or tuple(float)
        This length scale is :math:`c` in [GC99]_. This length scale determines
        the truncation to zero and the decay of the covariance function. The
        Gaspari-Cohn function is truncated to zero by 2 * length_scale.
    dist_func : func
        This distance function is used to determine the distance between states.
        This functions takes two different grid lists and estimates a distance
        between these two grids.
