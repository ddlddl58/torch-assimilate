  abstract = {A highly modular and scale-consistent Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP) is presented. The modeling platform consists of an atmospheric model (Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling; COSMO), a land surface model (the NCAR Community Land Model, version 3.5; CLM3.5), and a 3D variably saturated groundwater flow model (ParFlow). An external coupler (Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Soil, version 3.0; OASIS3) with multiple executable approaches is employed to couple the three independently developed component models, which intrinsically allows for a separation of temporal\textendash{}spatial modeling scales and the coupling frequencies between the component models.Idealized TerrSysMP simulations are presented, which focus on the interaction of key hydrologic processes, like runoff production (excess rainfall and saturation) at different hydrological modeling scales and the drawdown of the water table through groundwater pumping, with processes in the atmospheric boundary layer. The results show a strong linkage between integrated surface\textendash{}groundwater dynamics, biogeophysical processes, and boundary layer evolution. The use of the mosaic approach for the hydrological component model (to resolve subgrid-scale topography) impacts simulated runoff production, soil moisture redistribution, and boundary layer evolution, which demonstrates the importance of hydrological modeling scales and thus the advantages of the coupling approach used in this study.Real data simulations were carried out with TerrSysMP over the Rur catchment in Germany. The inclusion of the integrated surface\textendash{}groundwater flow model results in systematic patterns in the root zone soil moisture, which influence exchange flux distributions and the ensuing atmospheric boundary layer development. In a first comparison to observations, the 3D model compared to the 1D model shows slightly improved predictions of surface fluxes and a strong sensitivity to the initial soil moisture content.},

  abstract = {Data assimilation is an iterative approach to the problem of estimating the state of a dynamical system using both current and past observations of the system together with a model for the system's time evolution. Rather than solving the problem from scratch each time new observations become available, one uses the model to ``forecast'' the current state, using a prior state estimate (which incorporates information from past data) as the initial condition, then uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a current state estimate. This Bayesian approach is most effective when the uncertainty in both the observations and in the state estimate, as it evolves over time, are accurately quantified. In this article, we describe a practical method for data assimilation in large, spatiotemporally chaotic systems. The method is a type of ``ensemble Kalman filter'', in which the state estimate and its approximate uncertainty are represented at any given time by an ensemble of system states. We discuss both the mathematical basis of this approach and its implementation; our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational speed rather than improving accuracy over previously published approaches to ensemble Kalman filtering. We include some numerical results demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our implementation for assimilating real atmospheric data with the global forecast model used by the US National Weather Service.},

A model of the general circulation, consisting of three ordinary differential equations, is introduced. For different intensities of the axially symmetric and asymmetric thermal forcing, the equations may possess one or two stable steady-state solutions, one or two stable periodic solutions, or irregular (aperiodic) solutions. Qualitative reasoning which has been applied to the real atmosphere may sometimes be applied to the model, and checked for soundness by comparing the conclusions with numerical solutions. The implications of irregularity for the atmosphere and for atmospheric science are discussed.},

  doi = {10.1002/qj.49712555417},
  abstract = {This article focuses on the construction, directly in physical space, of simply parametrized covariance functions for data-assimilation applications. A self-contained, rigorous mathematical summary of relevant topics from correlation theory is provided as a foundation for this construction. Covariance and correlation functions are defined, and common notions of homogeneity and isotropy are clarified. Classical results are stated, and proven where instructive. Included are smoothness properties relevant to multivariate statistical-analysis algorithms where wind/wind and wind/mass correlation models are obtained by differentiating the correlation model of a mass variable. the Convolution Theorem is introduced as the primary tool used to construct classes of covariance and cross-covariance functions on three-dimensional Euclidean space R3. Among these are classes of compactly supported functions that restrict to covariance and cross-covariance functions on the unit sphere S2, and that vanish identically on subsets of positive measure on S2. It is shown that these covariance and cross-covariance functions on S2, referred to as being space-limited, cannot be obtained using truncated spectral expansions. Compactly supported and space-limited covariance functions determine sparse covariance matrices when evaluated on a grid, thereby easing computational burdens in atmospheric data-analysis algorithms. Convolution integrals leading to practical examples of compactly supported covariance and cross-covariance functions on R3 are reduced and evaluated. More specifically, suppose that gi and gj are radially symmetric functions defined on R3 such that gi(x) = 0 for |x| $>$ di and gj(x) = 0 for |xv $>$ dj, O $<$ di,dj $\leqq$, where |. | denotes Euclidean distance in R3. the parameters di and dj are `cut-off' distances. Closed-form expressions are determined for classes of convolution cross-covariance functions Cij(x,y) := (gi * gj)(x-y), i $\not =$ j, and convolution covariance functions Cii(x,y) := (gi * gi)(x-y), vanishing for |x - y| $>$ di + dj and |x - y| $>$ 2di, respectively, Additional covariance functions on R3 are constructed using convolutions over the real numbers R, rather than R3. Families of compactly supported approximants to standard second- and third-order autoregressive functions are constructed as illustrative examples. Compactly supported covariance functions of the form C(x,y) := Co(|x - y|), x,y $\in$ R3, where the functions Co(r) for r $\in$ R are 5th-order piecewise rational functions, are also constructed. These functions are used to develop space-limited product covariance functions B(x, y) C(x, y), x, y $\in$ S2, approximating given covariance functions B(x, y) supported on all of S2 \texttimes{} S2.},

The equations contain quadratic, linear, and constant terms representing advection, dissipation, and external forcing. Numerical integration indicates that small errors (differences between solutions) tend to double in about 2 days. Localized errors tend to spread eastward as they grow, encircling the globe after about 14 days.},
